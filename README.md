## What I've learned
* How to create backend application in **Spring Boot, Java**
* Working with **MongoDB**
* Deploying to **Google App Engine** on custom domain <br>

To learn more visit [frontend repository](https://github.com/adkuba/TL-frontend). Backend is avaiable on <code>www.api.tline.site</code>, waiting time may be longer as I'm running on cheaper server due to lack of founding.

## Localhost
On default project uses Atlas Mongodb, you can change configuration to run all in localhost. If you use localhost remember to run mongodb <code>sudo systemctl start mongod</code> Also remember to remove Google Cloud App Engine configuration, as project on default deploys to this platform.

## Wiki
Read [wiki](https://github.com/adkuba/TL-backend/wiki) to learn more about backend functionality.
